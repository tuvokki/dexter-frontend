===============

A frontend with expressjs to learn some stuff

This right now has borrowed some stuff from the [asok-backend](https://github.com/TuvokVersatileKolinahr/asok-backend) like the HelloProvider which has been rewritten to be more generic.

####Todo's are
* more robust way to easy create modules
* expand tests also for the POST routes
